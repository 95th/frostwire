# The FrostWire Monorepo

Welcome to the main FrostWire repository. 
Here you will find the sources necessary to build [FrostWire for Android](http://www.frostwire.com/android/?from=github) and [FrostWire for Desktop](http://www.frostwire.com/downloads/?from=github)

 * [/android](https://github.com/frostwire/frostwire/tree/master/android) Sources for FrostWire for Android
 * [/desktop](https://github.com/frostwire/frostwire/tree/master/desktop) Sources for FrostWire for Desktop (Windows, Mac, Linux)
 * [/common](https://github.com/frostwire/frostwire/tree/master/common) Common sources for the desktop and android client

In the past these sources were held at [frostwire-android](https://github.com/frostwire/frostwire-android), 
[frostwire-desktop](https://github.com/frostwire/frostwire-desktop) and [frostwire-common](https://github.com/frostwire/frostwire-common) and [https://github.com/frostwire/frostwire-common](frostwire-common) respectively.
**These repositories will no longer be used.**

# Tip 4 commit?

We've contacted the tip4commit team to help us migrate the balances left on those old repositories into this one.
They've promised to add this new project and to move the balances left on the old repos into this one.

# How to build

Instructions on how to build are included inside each project, we're still making the migration into this monorepo structure, so we'll accept gladly any commits refering to the README.md files found here.
